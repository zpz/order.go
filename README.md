# order

Functions for min, max, median, quantiles, partial sorts, nth element,
order, and rank. These functions all have a sorting or ordering operation
underneath. Of these functions, I believe partial sorts and n-th elements,
equivalent to the "partial_sort" and "nth_element" of the C++ Standard Library,
belong in the Go standard sort package sometime in the future.
